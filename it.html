            Information technology engineering (ITE) is the application of social and technical skills
         to design, manage and maintain technologies that help solve problems. ITE encompasses a wide 
         range of disciplinary specialties such as computer science, engineering, mathematical modelling,
          network administration and software development.
         <br>Purpose of B.Tech. (IT)<br>
        The purpose of the Information Technology Engineering is to prepare students for a career as 
        an IT professional. The program covers a wide range of topics from computer networking and 
        software development to information security and advanced system administration. The B.Tech.
         (ITE) program leads to the Bachelor of technology in Information Technology Engineering.

        <p>Information Technology Engineering is a new field that is quickly becoming a major force in
     the world of engineering. This new field has been created to address the new challenges posed by
      information technology. More specifically, the rapidly changing and expanding field of computers, 
    networks and Internet technology have created a need for new engineers. The world is becoming 
    computerized and information technologies are becoming increasingly more powerful and complex. 
    Computer hardware, software and networks have become an integral part of our society. The ability
     to design, implement and support these new technologies is a challenge that has been met with the 
     help of Information Technology Engineering.<br>
    IT engineers are those who design and implement computer hardware, software and networks. They are
     involved in the logical design of computers, how data is stored, transmitted and accessed by 
     computers. They create the blueprints for software programs, which tell computers how to store,
      access and transmit data. IT Engineer are responsible for computer security, software development 
      and network design. They often work with computer programmers, computer engineers and other 
      technology professions.IT engineers may be employed by governmental agencies, large corporations,
       or by small businesses. Some IT engineers work for consulting firms, where they provide advice and
        design solutions to companies that need help with their technology.
