                Computer science and engineering (CSE) or Computer Science (CS) also integrated as
             Electrical engineering and Computer Science (EECS) in some universities, is an academic 
             program at many universities which comprises approaches of computer science and computer 
             engineering. There is no clear division in computing between science and engineering, just
              like in the field of materials science and engineering. However, some classes are
               historically more related to computer science (e.g. data structures and algorithms),
                and other to computer engineering (e.g. computer architecture). CSE is also a term 
        often used in Europe to translate the name of technical or engineering informatics academic 
        programs. It is offered in both undergraduate as well postgraduate with specializations.[1]

                Academic programs vary between colleges, but typically include a combination of topics
             in computer science,computer engineering, and electrical engineering. Undergraduate courses
             usually include programming, algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, 
            operating systems, computer networks, parallel computing, embedded systems, algorithms
         design, circuit analysis and electronics, digital logic and processor design, computer graphics,
          scientific computing, software engineering, database systems, digital signal processing, 
          virtualization, computer simulations and games programming. CSE programs also include core 
          subjects of theoretical computer science such as theory of computation, numerical methods, 
          machine learning, programming theory and paradigms.[2] Modern academic programs also cover 
          emerging computing fields like image processing, data science, robotics, bio-inspired computing,
           computational biology, autonomic computing and artificial intelligence.[3] Most CSE programs
            require introductory mathematical knowledge, hence the first year of study is dominated by
         mathematical courses, primarily discrete mathematics, mathematical analysis, linear algebra, 
         probability, and statistics, as well as the introduction to physics and electrical and 
         electronic engineering.[1][4] Students usually also have the opportunity to choose one social 
         science subject.
